# CS2 java projects

This repository is simply a record of the projects I did for my Computer Science 2 class.
As I didnt come up with the bright idea to put this in a git repository until after im halfway through Computer Science 2, the inital commits will contain the first 7 labs, and later commits will be the other labs.

Feel free to look around, but keep in mind, as this was a data structures course, we were only rarely allowed to use built in java libraries, and built our own data structures from scratch.
